Computational Neuroscience Course Assignment

## What is STA ?
The spike-triggered average (STA) is a measure to relate a continuous signal and a simultaneously recorded spike train. It represents the average signal taken at the times of spike occurrences and with proper normalization is equivalent to the cross-correlation between the continuous signal and the spike train.

## Code Description
The data set provided with is recorded from the blowfly H1 neuron. In this experiment, an electrode is placed in the fly’s brain– in a region called the lobula plate– where there is a set of large neurons that encode information about wide-field motion, motion of the entire visual field. We are recording from one of these neurons, H1, which encodes horizontal motion.
